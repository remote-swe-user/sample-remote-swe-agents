# Remote SWE Agents

This is an example implementation of a fully autonomous software development AI agent. The agent works in its own dedicated development environment, freeing you from being tied to your laptop!

**TL;DR:** This is a self-hosted, fully open-source solution on AWS that offers a similar experience to Devin, OpenAI Codex, or Google Jules.

### Pull Requests Created by the Remote SWE Agents

You can view all the public pull requests created by the agent [here](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aremote-swe-user&type=pullrequests). All of the commits pushed from the GitHub user is written by the agent autonomously.

## Installation Steps

Since this project is fully self-hosted, the setup process requires several manual operations such as configuring a Slack app.
Please carefully follow all the steps below. If you encounter any issues, we're ready to help you via GitHub issues!

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 20 or higher)
- npm (version 9 or higher)
- AWS CLI
- AWS IAM profile with appropriate permissions
- Docker
- Bedrock Claude Sonnet 3.7 model is [enabled on](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/getting-started.html#getting-started-model-access) us-west-2 regions
- Slack Workspace
- GitHub Account

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/remote-swe-agents.git
cd remote-swe-agents
```

After completing this step, proceed to Step 2 to set up the required parameters and deploy the CDK stack.

### 2. Run CDK Deploy

Before running cdk deploy, you need to create placeholder SSM parameters that will later be populated with actual values:

```bash
aws ssm put-parameter \
    --name /remote-swe/slack/bot-token \
    --value "placeholder" \
    --type String

aws ssm put-parameter \
    --name /remote-swe/slack/signing-secret \
    --value "placeholder" \
    --type String

aws ssm put-parameter \
    --name /remote-swe/github/personal-access-token \
    --value "placeholder" \
    --type String
```

Then you can run cdk deploy. Note that the above parameter names are referenced in `bin/cdk.ts`.

```bash
cd cdk && npm ci
npx cdk bootstrap
npx cdk deploy --all
```

Deployment usually takes about 5 minutes. After the deployment, you should see the endpoint of your Slack Bolt app. Make note of the `SlackBoltEndpointUrl` from the CDK output as you'll need it in the next step.

After completing this step, proceed to Step 3 to set up your Slack application.

### 3. Slack App Setup

Now, you need to set up a Slack App to control agents through the Slack interface.

#### Create a Slack App

1. Go to [Slack API Dashboard](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click "Create New App"
3. Choose "From manifest"
4. Use the provided Slack app manifest YAML file: [manifest.json](./resources/slack-app-manifest.json)
   - Please replace the endpoint URL (`https://redacted.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`) with your actual URL
   - You can find your actual URL in the CDK deployment outputs as `SlackBoltEndpointUrl`
5. Please make note of the following values:
   - Signing Secret (found in Basic Information)
   - Bot Token (found in OAuth & Permissions, after installing to your workspace)

Please also refer to this document for more details: [Create and configure apps with manifests](https://api.slack.com/reference/manifests)

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using a shared (rather than personal) Slack workspace, consider setting the `ADMIN_USER_ID_LIST` environment variable (see below) to control agent access. Without this restriction, anyone in the workspace can access the agents and potentially your GitHub content.


#### Create SSM Parameters for Slack Secrets

After creating a Slack app, register the secrets in your AWS account by the following command:

```bash
aws ssm put-parameter \
    --name /remote-swe/slack/bot-token \
    --value "your-slack-bot-token" \
    --type String \
    --overwrite

aws ssm put-parameter \
    --name /remote-swe/slack/signing-secret \
    --value "your-slack-signing-secret" \
    --type String \
    --overwrite
```

Replace `your-slack-bot-token` and `your-slack-signing-secret` with the actual values you obtained in the previous step. The parameters will be referenced from CDK.

After completing this step, proceed to Step 4 to set up GitHub integration. You will need to choose between using a Personal Access Token (PAT) or GitHub App for authentication.


### 4. GitHub Integration

To interact with GitHub, you need to setup GitHub integration. You have two options for GitHub integration:

**Which option should you choose?**
- **Personal Access Token (Option 1)**: Choose this for personal use or quick setup. It's simpler but tied to a single user account.
- **GitHub App (Option 2)**: Recommended for team environments or organizational use. Provides more granular permissions and isn't tied to a personal account.

#### Option 1: Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Generate a new token (classic) with appropriate repository access
   * Required scopes: `repo, workflow, read:org`
   * The more scopes you permit, the more various tasks agents can perform
3. Create an SSM Parameter with the generated token string
   ```bash
   aws ssm put-parameter \
      --name /remote-swe/github/personal-access-token \
      --value "your-access-token" \
      --type String \
      --overwrite
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to share the system with multiple developers, it is recommended to create a [machine user account for GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/types-of-github-accounts#user-accounts) instead of using your own account's PAT, to prevent misuse of personal privileges.

#### Option 2: GitHub App

1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > GitHub Apps](https://github.com/settings/apps)
2. Create a new GitHub App
3. Configure permissions and generate a private key
   - the required permissions: Actions(RW), Issues(RW), Pull requests(RW), Contents(RW)
4. Create a parameter of [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/parameters) for the private key.
   - This parameter will be referenced from CDK (the default parameter name: `/remote-swe/github/app-private-key`).
5. Install the app to a GitHub organization you want to use.
   - After installing the app, you can find the installation id from the URL (`https://github.com/organizations/<YOUR_ORG>/settings/installations/<INSTALLATION_ID>`)
6. Please take a note of the below values:
   - App ID (e.g. 12345678)
   - Installation ID (e.g. 12345678)
   - Private key parameter name in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store

> [!NOTE]
> Currently when using with GitHub App, you can only use repositories under a single organization (i.e. app installation).

After completing this step, proceed to Step 5 to set up environment variables based on your chosen GitHub integration method.

### 5. Environment Variables Setup

The following environment variables are required for deployment:

#### For GitHub App Integration:

When you use GitHub App integration (option 2 above), you must set the below two environment variables when deploying CDK.

```sh
export GITHUB_APP_ID=your-github-app-id
export GITHUB_INSTALLATION_ID=your-github-installation-id
```

> [!NOTE]
> We use environment variables here to inject configuration from GitHub Actions variables. If this isn't convenient for you, you can simply hard-code the values in [`bin/cdk.ts`](cdk/bin/cdk.ts).

#### (optional) Restrict access to the system from the Slack

To control which members in the Slack workspace can access the agents, you can provide a comma-separated list of Slack User IDs in the following environment variable:

To get a member's Slack user ID, [follow these instructions](https://www.google.com/search?q=copy+member+id+slack).

```sh
export ADMIN_USER_ID_LIST=U123ABC456,U789XYZ012
```

All users except those with specified user IDs will receive an Unauthorized error when attempting to access the Slack app.

> [!NOTE]
> To grant a user access to the app, mention the app with an `approve_user` message followed by mentions of the users, e.g., `@remote-swe approve_user @Alice @Bob @Carol`

After completing this step, proceed to Step 6 to finalize the deployment with your configuration.

### 6. Deploy CDK again with configuration variables

After the above setup is complete, run `cdk deploy` again.

```bash
cd cdk
npx cdk deploy
```

Congratulations! Setup is now complete. You can now access all features from Slack. Simply mention the Slack app and start assigning tasks to the agents!

For tips on how to effectively use the agents, refer to the "Useful Tips" section below.

## Useful Tips

### Prompting Best Practices

When you start an agent, your instruction should include at least the below content:

1. Which GitHub repository should they see
2. Describe the feature or bug you want to solve
3. What file should they check first (file path would be the best, but only keywords can also work)

To simplify the workflow, you can create a GitHub issue in the repository containing the information above, and just give the agent its URL.
This way the repository is automatically inferred from the URL, and it can also link the new PR to the corresponding issue.

### Integrating with MCP Servers

As our agent can work as an MCP client, you can easily integrate it with various MCP servers. To configure the integration, you can edit [`mcp.json`](./packages/worker/mcp.json) and run CDK deploy. For example,

```json
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.cdk-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.cdk-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      }
    }
  }
```

All the new agents can now use MCP servers as their tools.

### Overriding the Foundation Model

By default the Remote SWE uses Claude Sonnet 3.7 as the foundation model. You can override this configuration by the below steps:

1. Edit [cdk/lib/constructs/worker/index.ts](./cdk/lib/constructs/worker/index.ts) to set the environment variable `MODEL_OVERRIDE` for the worker service. The available values are: `sonnet3.5v1, sonnet3.5, sonnet3.7, haiku3.5, nova-pro, opus4, and sonnet4`
   ```diff
   Environment=BEDROCK_AWS_ROLE_NAME=${props.loadBalancing?.roleName ?? ''}
   + Environment=MODEL_OVERRIDE=nova-pro

   [Install]
   ```
2. Run cdk deploy
3. New workers now use the override model.

Note that this feature is highly experimental and we generally recommend to use the default model for optimized experience.

## How it works

This system utilizes a Slack Bolt application to manage user interactions and implement a scalable worker system. Here's the main workflow:

1. **Message Reception and Processing**
   - When a user sends a message in Slack, it's forwarded to the Slack Bolt application via webhook
   - API Gateway receives the webhook request and passes it to a Lambda function

2. **Event Management and Message Distribution**
   - The Lambda function publishes user messages to AppSync Events
   - Message history is stored in DynamoDB for reference in subsequent processing

3. **Worker System Management**
   - When a new Slack thread is created, the Worker Manager is notified
   - The Worker Manager provisions a Worker Unit consisting of an EC2 instance and EBS volume
   - Each Worker Unit contains an SWE agent responsible for the actual processing

4. **Feedback Loop**
   - Worker Units subscribe to AppSync Events to receive user messages
   - Processing results and progress updates are sent back to Slack as replies to the user
   - Job statuses are managed in DynamoDB

This architecture enables a scalable and reliable messaging processing system. The combination of serverless components (Lambda, API Gateway) and dedicated EC2 instances per worker ensures resource isolation and flexible scalability.

## Cost

The following table provides a sample cost breakdown for deploying this system in the us-east-1 (N. Virginia) region for one month.

Here we assume you request 100 sessions per month. The monthly cost is proportional to the number of sessions. (e.g. If you only run 20 session/month, multiply it with 20/100.)

| AWS service | Dimensions | Cost [USD/month] |
|-------------|------------|------------------|
| EC2 | t3.large, 1 hour/session | 8.32 |
| EBS | 50 GB/instance, 1 day/instance | 13.33 |
| DynamoDB | Read: 1000 RRU/session | 0.0125 |
| DynamoDB | Write: 200 WRU/session | 0.0125 |
| DynamoDB | Storage: 2 MB/session | 0.05 |
| AppSync Events | Requests: 20 events/session | 0.002 |
| AppSync Events | Connection: 1 hour/session | 0.00048 |
| Lambda | Requests: 30 invocations/session | 0.0006 |
| Lambda | Duration: 128MB, 1s/invocation | 0.00017 |
| API Gateway | Requests: 20 requests/session | 0.002 |
| Bedrock | Input (cache write): Sonnet 3.7 100k tokens/session | 37.5 |
| Bedrock | Input (cache read): Sonnet 3.7 1M tokens/session | 30.00 |
| Bedrock | Output: Sonnet 3.7 20k tokens/session | 30.00 |
| TOTAL | | 120 |

Additionally, when the system is not in use (i.e., no messages are sent to the agents), the ongoing costs are minimal (~0 USD).

## Clean up
You can clean up all the resources you created by the following commands:

```sh
npx cdk destroy --force
```

> [!NOTE]  
> When executing `cdk deploy`, an EC2 Image Builder pipeline is launched asynchronously. Please wait at least 30 minutes after deployment before destroying the stack. If stack deletion fails, wait about 30 minutes and try `cdk destroy` again.
